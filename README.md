# Coal Production Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis and basic regression modeling using a coal production dataset. The dataset contains yearly data on different coal categories such as coking coal, non-coking coal, total coal, and coal derivatives or by-products including hard coke and washed coke.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of annual production values for multiple coal categories. Each record represents a financial year and corresponding coal production statistics.

## Objectives
- Understand relationships between different coal attributes
- Visualize correlations using a correlation matrix (heatmap)
- Apply regression analysis to study trends and dependencies among variables

## Methodology
The analysis involves data loading, preprocessing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling to explore relationships between coal production variables.

## Results
The project produces a correlation matrix to visualize relationships between attributes and regression outputs to analyze trends and dependencies.

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn
